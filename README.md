## About Champloo &#126;kakimazeru&#126;
This artwork is a platform that allows users to create collages based on a specific theme. Viewers can use the diverse and distincitve elements created by others to craft a unique, one-time-only collage.
This unique creation will ultimately inspire you to reflect on that theme. Though each element may seem disparate at first glance, you will find that they share subtle connections.

## iii exhibition
The iii exhibition is an event where students from the Graduate School of Interdisciplinary Information Studies, as well as members from various diverse backgrounds, present their learnings and insights from their university life in the form of “works” without being restricted by the format of the output. The students take full initiative, from creating the works to planning and managing the event.

## Concept
Technology and art, humans and machines, works and viewers...
When we measure the distance between ourselves and the world, is it acceptable to remain in a vague and passive space, neither attached nor detached from these things?
Through this exhibition, we aim to actively pursue the construction of new relationships, embracing undulation of duration as we move back and forth between engagement and disengagement.
